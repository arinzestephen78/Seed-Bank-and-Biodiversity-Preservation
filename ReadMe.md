# Seed Tracker - Blockchain Agricultural Management System

## Overview

Seed Tracker is a decentralized blockchain application built on Stacks, designed to empower agricultural communities by providing transparent, immutable tracking of seed growth, reputation management, and seed provenance.

## Contracts

### 1. GrowthTracker Contract
Responsible for recording and managing plant growth data.

#### Key Features:
- Track seed growth stages
- Record planting dates
- Log height progression
- Capture yield information

#### Functions:
- `record-growth-data`: Log individual growth stages for a specific seed
- `record-yield`: Record the final yield of a crop
- `get-growth-data`: Retrieve complete growth history for a seed

### 2. ReputationSystem Contract
Manages user reputation within the agricultural ecosystem.

#### Key Features:
- Track user performance
- Reward successful grows
- Recognize conservation efforts

#### Functions:
- `update-reputation`: Update a user's reputation score
- `get-reputation`: Retrieve a user's current reputation metrics

### 3. SeedNFT Contract
Implements a non-fungible token (NFT) system for unique seed tracking.

#### Key Features:
- Mint unique seed NFTs
- Store seed metadata
- Enable seed transfer between users
- Preserve genetic information

#### Functions:
- `mint-seed-nft`: Create a new seed NFT with detailed metadata
- `transfer`: Transfer seed NFT ownership
- `get-seed-info`: Retrieve comprehensive seed information
- `get-owner`: Determine current seed NFT owner

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Seed Provenance**: Farmers can track the entire lifecycle of a seed from genetic origin to final yield.
2. **Reputation Building**: Users earn reputation by successfully growing crops and participating in conservation efforts.
3. **Genetic Preservation**: Each seed is a unique NFT with stored genetic information.

## Technical Details

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Token Standard**: Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
